# OptimizationProject

This project is a group project, it's a part of the Nonlinear Optimization course at Chalmers University of Technology.

My role in this project is to formulate a problem into a mathematical formulation, implement a code to solve the problem, and oversee the report.

The instructor gave us data of the 14 plannable power plants in Sweden and consumer demands.

The goals of this project is to formulate a minimization problem to minimize the cost of the production of electricity while satisfying consumer demands and the constraints of each power plants.

This project is implemented using Julia and JuMP.

The results are in the report file, and the implemented code are in the appendix of the report.
