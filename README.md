# OptimizationProject

This project is part of TMA947 Nonlinear Optimization course at Chalmers University of Technology

The instructor gave us a data of the 14 plannable powerplants in Sweden and consumer demands.

The goals of this project is to formulate a minimization problem to minimize the cost of the production of electricity while satisfied the consumer damands and the constraints of each powerplants.

This project is implemented using Julia and JuMP. The result are in the report file.
